`artyfarty` is a collection of ggplot themes published by
[dataroots](http://dataroots.io).

## Fork notice

The original package has not been in active development for \>= 2 years,
and since then, some things have changes. This fork aims to bring the
themes up to speed with regard to missing features, like setting
fonts/colors for the `subtitle` ggplot2 elements missing in the original
package.

## Installation

You can install the development version of artyfarty from with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("tadaadata/artyfarty")
```
